# PyBMap

The real scripts are placed in sub PyBMap folder. This folder is served for testbench scripts placing.  
Place any testbench files (e.g. `testbench.py`) in there what you want and don't sumbit them.  
The native BMap library should be placed in sub PyBMap folder, and I have used gitignore file to filter them.
The native BMap library must be named as `BMap.dll` in any platforms (e.g. Linux, macOS). Do not change name to `BMap.so` or `BMap.dylib`.
