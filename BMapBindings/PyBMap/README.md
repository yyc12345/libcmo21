# PyBMap

The real scripts are placed in sub PyBMap folder. This folder is served for testbench scripts placing. You can run `testbench.py` to do a basic test for PyBMap but you may need some essential files to run this testbench which were written in `testbench.py`.

The native BMap library should be placed in sub PyBMap folder, and I have used gitignore file to filter them. The native BMap library must be named as `BMap.dll` (in Windows), `BMap.so` (in Linux or BSD), or `BMap.dylib` (in macOS). If you still can not load BMap or your system is not listed above, you should name it as `BMap.bin`.

Please note the most content of `virtools_types.py` are generated by EnumsMigration sub-project. Additionally the most content of `bmap.py` is generated by BMapBindings. So if some structs are updated, do not forget checking these files.
