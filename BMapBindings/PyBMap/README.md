# PyBMap

The real scripts are placed in sub PyBMap folder. This folder is served for testbench scripts placing. Place any testbench files (e.g. `testbench.py`) in there what you want and don't sumbit them (`testbench.py` is explicitly excluded by gitignore file).

The native BMap library should be placed in sub PyBMap folder, and I have used gitignore file to filter them. The native BMap library must be named as `BMap.dll` (in Windows), `BMap.so` (in Linux or BSD), or `BMap.dylib` (in macOS). If you still can not load BMap or your system is not listed above, you should name it as `BMap.bin`.

Please note the most content of `virtools_types.py` are generated by EnumsMigration sub-project, so if some structs are updated, do not forget checking this file. Additionally the whole `bmap.py` is generated by BMapBindings, if something need to be changed, please modify the template of BMapBindings and do not midify the result directly.
