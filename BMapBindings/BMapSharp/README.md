# BMapSharp

The core of BMapSharp project is placed within `BMapSharp` subdirectory. This directory also contain a testbench project of `BMapSharp`, called `BMapSharpTestbench`. You can build it and do basic test for `BMapSharp`.

The native BMap library should be placed together with managed `BMapSharp` dynamic library. I use gitignore file to filter all native binary so you need put them manually. The native BMap library must be named as `BMap.dll` (in Windows), `BMap.so` (in Linux or BSD), or `BMap.dylib` (in macOS). If you still can not load BMap or your system is not listed above, you should name it as `BMap.bin`.

The most content of `VirtoolsTypes.cs` is generated by EnumsMigration, and the most content of `BMap.cs` is generated by BMapBindings. You should watch these file changes if corresponding C++ code or structures are changed.
