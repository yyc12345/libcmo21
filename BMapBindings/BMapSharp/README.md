# BMapSharp

The core of BMapSharp project is placed within `BMapSharp` subdirectory. This directory also contain a testbench project of `BMapSharp`, called `BMapSharpTestbench`. You can build it and do basic test for `BMapSharp`.

The native BMap library should be placed together with managed `BMapSharp` dynamic library. I use gitignore file to filter all native binary so you need put them manually. The native BMap library must be named as `BMap.dll` (in Windows), `BMap.so` (in Linux or BSD), or `BMap.dylib` (in macOS). If you still can not load BMap or your system is not listed above, you should name it as `BMap.bin`.

The most content of `VirtoolsTypes.cs` is generated by EnumsMigration, and the most content of `BMap.cs` is generated by BMapBindings. You should watch these file changes if corresponding C++ code or structures are changed.

Since BMap 0.3.0, testbench use command line arguments, instead of hardcode variables in code, as the arguments of BMap. It is convenient that debug BMapSharp without any modification of source code. For a brief instruction, you may need to launch BMapSharpTestbench in following command (just an example. you can modify it as you wished): `dotnet run -- --file-path "LightCameraTest.nmo" --temp-dir "Temp" --texture-dir "F:/Ballance/Ballance/Textures" --encodings cp1252 gb2312`.
