# libcmo21

The aim of this project is creating a universal library which can read / write CMO files or any other Virtools files without any Virtools dependencies.  
This project will not link any original Virtools dynamic library. So this project can run on both of x64 and x86 platform.  
This project only involving specific Virtools version, 2.1. Other Virtools version are not considered by this project.

This project is based on reverse work of CK2.dll, VxMath.dll and CK2_3D.dll. The program [unvirt](https://aluigi.altervista.org/papers.htm#unvirt) created by Luigi Auriemma, which is licensed by GPL-v2, also help my work.  

For some personal reason, this project will keep a clean room with all doyaGu's projects. All variables and logic are based on my understanding and reversed code. This is my personal behavior, please forgive my decision if you dislike it.
